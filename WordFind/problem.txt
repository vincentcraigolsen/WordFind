Problem Definition:
-------------------
Given a N X N grid with a random english language letter in each cell and 
an english dictionary (englishwords.txt), write a program to generate all
valid words that can be found in the grid. 

A valid word in grid should
 a. be present in englishwords.txt
 b. cells containing adjacent letters in the word should be neighbors.
 c. each cell can be used only once in the word.

Example:
-------

A 4 x 4 grid 

   ---------------
  | A | A | Q | U |
   ---------------
  | I | D | F | U |
   ---------------
  | D | L | G | Y |
   ---------------
  | L | M | K | X |
   ---------------

Following words can be made from this grid:
ilk, guy, did, aid, qadi, glia, km, id, lid, ail, ufa, fad, ufd, ad, ml

These are valid words from englishwords.txt included in this directory. 

Input format:
------------
input grid should be read from a file named grid.txt (sample included in this directory)
First line contains the number of rows and columns. Each following line has the elements
of the row. 

For the example grid input grid.txt will contain

4 4
A A Q U
I D F U
D L G Y
L M K X

Output format:
-------------
The program should write output to stdout. First line should state the total number 
of words found followed by one word per line in lexicographically sorted order.
For above example grid the output will look as follows -

20
